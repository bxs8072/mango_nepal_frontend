        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This website is the one-in-all useful resource destination for Nepalese residing in the US and can be utilized by others throughout the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the vision of MangoNepal is to serve as a networking platform for Nepalese professionals from various backgrounds. Professionals from different work fields can sign up themselves for mentorship programs, educational guidance, career guidance, networking, and many more other possible opportunities. This cross-sectional interaction will help uplift our Nepalese youth, professionals, community, and the nation itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Young Nepalese talents are constantly looking for opportunities in various work disciplines. MangoNepal can facilitate a kick-start by connecting them with someone&nbsp;who has been in their shoes with a similar background. A professional engineer who arrived on an F-1 Visa and then completed internships, gained professional experience in the work industry can advise a freshly graduated student in a similar field. They can advise fresh batch on the current skill sets in demand, guide them on preparing for the workforce and help them step into the work industry. MangoNepal can also help find professionals such as: accountants, lawyers, doctors, IT personnel, and so on with Nepalese background for their specific needs.&nbsp;We believe with mutual cooperation, support, help, and we all can plan future endeavors smoothly.</p>
